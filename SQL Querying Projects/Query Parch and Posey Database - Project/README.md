## Parch and Posey Database Querying
**SQLite** is used to browse the `pandp.db` database and apply the queries in the `queries.txt` file to answer the following questions:
- What Sales Representatives have the most accounts?
- How many Sales Representatives are there per Region?
- Which Accounts had the largest smallest order?
- What region had the highest total order amount?
Data retrieved from these queries is then exported to **CSV** and opened in **Excel** to generate summary visualizations reported in the `report.pdf` with some analysis statements.
